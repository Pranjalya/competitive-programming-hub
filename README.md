There are N students in Ninja’s classroom, including him, numbered from 1 to N. All of them got some amount of money in their pockets ( as all of them saved some amount of their pocket money). Lets money[i] denotes the amount of money the ith student has got (1<= i <=N).  
The monitor of the class can get the money of all students whose number is a factor of monitor’s number. For example, if there are 6 students in class and the 4th student is the monitor of class then he can get the money from 1st and 2nd student.
Note: The money of the monitor remains with him.  
So can you tell the amount of money ith (1<= i <=N) student will have if he became the monitor of the class.

Ninja got a string S (consists of lower case alphabets ‘a’-’z’ ) from one of his friends for his birthday but Ninja prefers the string which consists of only one type of character like “aaaa” , ”bbbbb” , “ccc” but not “aabc” , ”bcde” as they contain more than one type of character. So he wants to change the string S such that it contains only one type of character. If multiple strings exist he want the one which has the maximum length and if two strings have the same length he wants one which contains a lexicographically smaller character than the other.

For example S=”aaaabbbb” output will be “aaaa” not “bbbb” because ‘a’ is lexicographically smaller than ‘b’.
