The length of the longest common prefix of two strings s=s1s2…sn and t=t1t2…tm is defined as the maximum integer k (0≤k≤min(n,m)) such that s1s2…sk equals t1t2…tk

.

Koa the Koala initially has n+1
strings s1,s2,…,sn+1

.

For each i
(1≤i≤n) she calculated ai — the length of the longest common prefix of si and si+1

.

Several days later Koa found these numbers, but she couldn't remember the strings.

So Koa would like to find some strings s1,s2,…,sn+1
which would have generated numbers a1,a2,…,an

. Can you help her?

If there are many answers print any. We can show that answer always exists for the given constraints.
Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains t
(1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
(1≤n≤100) — the number of elements in the list a

.

The second line of each test case contains n
integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤50) — the elements of a

.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
over all test cases does not exceed 100

.
Output

For each test case:

Output n+1
lines. In the i-th line print string si (1≤|si|≤200), consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Length of the longest common prefix of strings si and si+1 has to be equal to ai
